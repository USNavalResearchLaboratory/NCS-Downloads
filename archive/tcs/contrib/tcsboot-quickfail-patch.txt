The default behavior of tcsboot 1.0 is that for hosts that should not netboot,
it does not provide a DHCP lease.  The result is that the host.s attempt to
netboot will time out waiting for a DHCP response and (in the usual
configuration) it will fail over to booting from the local disk.  One problem
with this approach is that the timeout can take a while.  For example, on Sun
Fire X2100 machines, the default behavior on at least the nVidia network
adapter is to wait five minutes for a DHCP reply.  (There may be a way to
adjust that, but it wasn.t immediately obvious to me.)

The attached patch (against tcsboot-1.0) modifies the tcsboot program so that
instead of withholding a DHCP response, the DHCP server responds and assigns
an address, but points the client to a nonexistent boot image.  In our
testbed, at least (Dell Dimension 3000 & 3100 and Sun Fire X2100 hosts), this
causes a quick failover to booting from local disk.

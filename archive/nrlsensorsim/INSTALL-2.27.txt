TITLE: Installing NRL's Sensor Network extensions to NS-2.27

AUTHOR: Ian Downard <nrlsensorsim@pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil>

DATE: April 2004

ABSTRACT:

  These instructions describe how to install the code necessary for simulating
  sensor networks in the Network Simulator, version 2.27, distributed by the
  Information Sciences Institute at the USC School of Engineering [1]. 


QUICK AND DIRTY INSTALLATION:

  Download nrlsensorsim-2.27.tgz.

  A script has been written to automatically patch the ns-2.27. That script is
  called "patch_script-2.27.sh", and must be run from the nrlsensorsim-2.27/
  directory, which in turn must be located in the same directory that has the
  ns-allinone-2.27 directory.  So here's the procedure:

    tar -xzvf ns-allinone-2.27.tgz
    tar -xzvf nrlsensorsim-2.27.tgz
    cd nrlsensorsim-2.27/
    ./patch_script-2.27.sh
    cd ../ns-allinone-2.27/
    ./install


  Our extensions to ns-2.27 do not yet include support for the NRLOLSR routing
  algorithm.  If you desire NRLOSLR, download our patches for ns-2.26.


PATCHING SUMMARY:

Some of ISI's enhancements added to ns-2.27 were removed in order to force in
compatibility with our sensor network extensions.  The side effects of our
hacks are not yet understood.  Users should corroborate their simulation
results as much as possible with earlier versions of ns.


PATCHING DETAILS:

Here are the problems I've fixed with ns-2.27 (first two are in mac/channel.cc):

1. WirelessChannel::sendUp contains an else structure with list-based
  improvements. I reverted that else structure back to what it was in 2.26. 
  Without this  modification, PHENOM packets will never get received.


2. WirelessChannel::updateNodesList contains a call to sortLists().  I removed
  that call in order to fix a segmentation fault.


3. The makefiles
    ns-2.27/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest/Makefile,
    ns-2.27/indep-utils/webtrace-conv/conv/Makefile, and
    ns-2.27/indep-utils/webtrace-conv/dec/Makefile,
  needed to be modified in order to fix a bug in ISI's distribution.  The bug
  caused a compile-time error that looked like this:

  g++ -c -Dstand_alone -DSTL_NAMESPACE=@STL_NAMESPACE@  -o setdest.o setdest.cc
  In file included from ../../../config.h:54,
                   from setdest.h:5,
                   from setdest.cc:57:
  ../../../autoconf.h:85: Error: namespace `CPP_NAMESPACE' undeclared
  setdest.cc:71:1: warning: "INFINITY" redefined
  In file included from /usr/include/math.h:40,
                   from setdest.cc:43:
  /usr/include/bits/mathdef.h:35:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
  make[1]: *** [setdest.o] Error 1
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/iandow/netsim/ns-allinone-2.27/ns-2.27/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest'
  make[1]: Entering directory `/home/iandow/netsim/ns-allinone-2.27/ns-2.27/indep-utils/webtrace-conv/dec'

  To fix the bug, edit ns-2.27/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest/Makefile and 
  change this line:
    DEFINE = -Dstand_alone -DSTL_NAMESPACE=@STL_NAMESPACE@
  to this line:
    DEFINE = -Dstand_alone -DSTL_NAMESPACE=@STL_NAMESPACE@ -DCPP_NAMESPACE=std

  In the other two makefiles, append  -DCPP_NAMESPACE=std  to CFLAGS.

  I discovered that fix by searching the NS news database[2] for
    "CPP_NAMESPACE".
